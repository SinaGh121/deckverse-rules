    <!-- Players -->
    <section id="players">
      <h2>Number of Players</h2>
      <p>
        The ideal player count is between 8 and 13. As a rule of thumb, include one werewolf for every three villagers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Groups -->
    <section id="groups">
      <h4>Factions</h4>
      <p>Players are split into two broad factions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Villagers:</strong> roles like Woodsman, Alchemist, Seer, Resurrector, Guard, and other special characters.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Werewolves:</strong> roles like Alpha, Black Wolf, Wizard, and other related roles.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The game is moderated by the Game Master.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Flow -->
    <section id="flow">
      <h2>Game Flow</h2>
      <p>The game alternates between Night and Day phases.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Intro Day -->
    <section id="intro-day">
      <h3>Introduction Day</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each player only knows their own role; werewolves do not yet know their teammates.
        </li>
        <li>Each player has one minute to introduce themselves.</li>
        <li>No challenges or voting take place on this day.</li>
        <li>
          Then, during the Introduction Night, the Game Master wakes the werewolf team so they can recognize each other.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Game Days -->
    <section id="game-days">
      <h3>Game Days</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each day, speaking turns rotate (clockwise or counterclockwise) and every player gets one minute to speak.
        </li>
        <li>
          Through accusation, challenge, defense, and voting, players try to identify the werewolves.
        </li>
        <li>Players may signal their opinions with hand signs.</li>
        <li>
          Any player can request a challenge from the current speaker using a hand sign and speak for 30 seconds out of turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          No one may directly or indirectly refer to their role or their night abilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Revealing roles or night events is forbidden. If a role is revealed, the offending player is eliminated at the start of the next day.
        </li>
        <li>
          Players may only refer to Vanilla Villager, Werewolves, or people outside the game.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Discipline -->
    <section id="discipline">
      <h3>Disciplinary Rules</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>First offense: Warning from the Game Master.</li>
        <li>Second offense: Disciplinary silence (the player may not speak).</li>
        <li>Third offense: The player loses voting rights for that day, or if they are in defense, they may not speak.</li>
        <li>Fourth offense: The player is expelled from the game.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Voting -->
    <section id="voting">
      <h3>Voting Process</h3>

      <h4>Phase 1</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Any player who receives votes from at least half of the players present goes to the defense stage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Example: In a 5 or 6 player game, at least 3 votes are required to enter defense.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Phase 2</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If only one person enters defense, they may choose two players to speak: one to speak against them (Target) and one to support them (Cover). Each of these two has 1 minute to speak.
        </li>
        <li>
          If two people are in defense, each may choose only one person to speak about them (no separate Target and Cover).
        </li>
        <li>
          If three or more are in defense, none of them may select anyone to speak about them. No Target, no Cover, not even a general about.
        </li>
        <li>Each defender has 1 minute to defend.</li>
        <li>
          During defenses, no player may show any reaction such as like, dislike, or any hand signal. If someone violates this, they lose their voting right for that day and none of their votes that day will be counted.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Phase 3</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If only one person is in defense: they are eliminated with votes from at least half of the players present.
        </li>
        <li>
          If multiple are in defense: the one with the highest number of votes is eliminated.
        </li>
        <li>If there is a tie: no one is eliminated.</li>
        <li>
          Repeated voting is allowed: anyone may vote for more than one person in both phases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Players in defense may still vote.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Will -->
    <section id="will">
      <h4>Last Words</h4>
      <p>
        A player eliminated by majority vote may give a short will.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Night Inquiry -->
    <section id="night-inquiry">
      <h2>Night Inquiry</h2>
      <p>
        At the start of each day, players may ask up to two times (in 9 to 13 player games): "How many werewolf footprints were seen last night?" meaning the number of werewolves who opened their eyes together the previous night.
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>The number of inquiries scales with the player count.</li>
        <li>
          If the werewolves kill one of their own, that victim is not counted among the werewolves reported as awake.
        </li>
        <li>
          On a night when the Black Wolf attempts a conversion, the Game Master announces that the Black Wolf is attempting to convert a villager, whether successful or not.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a player is butchered at night, the Game Master announces at the start of the next day that the player was "butchered."
        </li>
        <li>
          If the Black Wolf successfully converts a villager at night, the night inquiry reports the werewolf count including the newly converted member.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the Alchemist kills a werewolf, the night inquiry still counts that werewolf, since the report is logged before the Alchemist's kill resolves.
          <ul>
            <li>Example: Suppose there are 3 werewolves, one is killed by the Alchemist, and the werewolves' attack is blocked by the Guard. In the morning, players do not know whether the night kill was a werewolf or a villager, because the inquiry was taken before the werewolf's death and still reported 3 werewolves.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Wake Order -->
    <section id="wake-order">
      <h2>Night Wake Order</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Woodsman - if they were eliminated by day vote the previous day.</li>
        <li>Werewolves</li>
        <li>Guard</li>
        <li>Seer</li>
        <li>Resurrector</li>
        <li>Alchemist</li>
        <li>Woodsman - if they were killed by the werewolves this night.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Important Notes</h3>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>
          At night, the werewolves may choose instead of a normal attack or conversion to guess a player's exact role and perform Butchery. If the guess is correct, that player is eliminated immediately.
          <ul>
            <li>This is evaluated against the player's original card role. Even if they later became a Vanilla Villager, Butchery is still checked against the original role.</li>
            <li>Alpha is not required. Even if Alpha is dead, the remaining werewolves can perform Butchery by group consensus.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          After each night ends, before players open their eyes, the Game Master asks everyone to extend one hand. If a player was turned into a werewolf by the Alchemist, the Game Master touches that player's hand.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a player has been converted into a werewolf:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Until the next night, they do not know the other werewolves.
            </li>
            <li>The other werewolves also do not know that this player has joined them.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

                If the Canary is eliminated, whether by day vote, by a werewolf attack, or by the Woodsman, then on the following night the werewolves may take no action: no attack, no Butchery, and no conversion. This disablement is not publicly announced by the Game Master.

                The Canary cannot be converted. Although they believe they are a Vanilla Villager, they actually count as a role-holding villager.
