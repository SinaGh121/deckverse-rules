      <h4>
        Butchery
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each night, instead of the usual attack or a conversion, the werewolves may guess a player’s exact role and
          butcher them.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the guess is correct, the player is immediately eliminated; if wrong, the werewolves’ night action is spent
          and no death occurs from them.
        </li>
        <li>
          The check is against the player’s initial role card; if someone was turned into a Vanilla Villager during the
          game, the initial role still applies.
        </li>
        <li>
          The presence or absence of Alpha does not matter; the remaining werewolves may agree collectively to perform a
          butchery.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a butchery happens, the Moderator announces in the morning that the player was “butchered.”
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>
        Woodsman
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When the Woodsman leaves the game, the Moderator announces it; the Woodsman immediately names one player as a
          companion to take down with them, and the Moderator announces that name.
        </li>
        <li>
          The result is immediate; if successful, the companion is eliminated at once.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>
        Alchemist
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          After each night and before eyes open, the Moderator asks everyone to extend one hand. If a player has been
          converted into a werewolf by the Alchemist’s ability, the Moderator touches that player’s hand.
        </li>
        <li>
          The converted player does not know the other werewolves until the next night, and the werewolves are unaware
          of their joining until then.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Status Checks
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At the start of any day, players may ask the Moderator to announce how many villagers and how many werewolves
          have been eliminated so far.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 9 to 13 player games, at most 2 checks are allowed. (The number of checks scales with player count.)

      <h2>
        No Role Disclosure
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Revealing roles or night abilities is strictly forbidden (directly or indirectly). Violation leads to
          elimination at the start of the next day.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may only reference Vanilla Villager, Werewolves, or people outside the game.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Seer may not make a definitive claim that someone is a werewolf based solely on a positive check without
          daytime reasoning. If this rule is broken, the Seer is eliminated at the start of the next day.

                If killed at night by the werewolves, at the end of that night they may eliminate one player. If

              <li>
                If butchered, they have no right to eliminate; if bewitched that day, their action is nullified.

                The Canary card is not in the main deck; during Introduction Night, the Moderator secretly designates

                If the Canary leaves the game in any way, on the next night the werewolves have no action: no attack, no
                butchery, no conversion. This suspension is not publicly announced.

              <li>
                The Canary cannot be converted and is considered a powered role (not a Vanilla Villager) for rules
