      <h2>Phases</h2>
      <h3>Night</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Moderator: “Everyone close your eyes.”</li>
        <li>Werewolves open eyes and silently pick a target.</li>
        <li>Doctor selects someone to protect.</li>
        <li>Seer checks one player’s alignment.</li>
        <li>Other special roles act as applicable.</li>

      </ol>
      <h3>Day</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Moderator announces if anyone was eliminated overnight.</li>
        <li>Open discussion. Players may accuse, defend, and share suspicions.</li>
        <li><strong>Lynch vote:</strong> Use majority voting. Optional: timed discussion (e.g., 3–5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Eliminated players reveal role and leave the circle (no table talk).</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="voting" class="card">
      <h2>Voting & timing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use simple majority to eliminate during day. On ties, revote; if tied again, no one is eliminated.</li>
        <li>Recommended round pacing: <span class="kbd">Night: 30–60s</span>, <span class="kbd">Day: 3–5min</span>, <span class="kbd">Vote: 30s</span>.</li>
        <li>Silent/thumbs voting helps large groups. Use the DeckVerse timer if available.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="end" class="card">
      <h2>Endgame & win conditions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Village wins</strong> when all Werewolves are eliminated.</li>
        <li><strong>Werewolves win</strong> when they are equal to or outnumber the remaining players.</li>
        <li>Some optional roles (e.g., Tanner) have unique win conditions.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="variants" class="card">
      <h2>Variants & house rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No first-night kill:</strong> First night ends without a kill to ease in new players.</li>
        <li><strong>Reveal/no-reveal:</strong> Decide whether eliminated players reveal roles.</li>
        <li><strong>Secret Doctor:</strong> Doctor cannot self-protect twice in a row (optional).</li>
        <li><strong>Seer cadence:</strong> Seer acts every night or odd nights only.</li>

    <section id="faq" class="card">
      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <h3>Can players talk at night?</h3>
      <p>No. Only roles that act at night open their eyes. Everyone else remains silent.</p>
      <h3>What if the Werewolves and Doctor target the same player?</h3>
      <p>The target survives if protected that night.</p>
      <h3>Can eliminated players speak?</h3>
      <p>No. They leave the circle and may not influence the game.</p>
